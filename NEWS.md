## v0.6.0

v0.6.0 introduces support for Sekiro mod profiles, portable installations and fixes a number of issues:

- Excessive memory usage/poor performance
- Compatibility with Seamless Coop
- Support for macOS via Crossover
- Custom Steam compatibility tools (e.g. Proton GE)

Additionally binaries are now signed by a Code Signing certificate issued by Certum and preemptively submitted to VirusTotal.
This should avoid anti-virus vendors flagging me3 as potentially unwanted software going forward.
